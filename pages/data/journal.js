		  "question": "What is the Berkeley Student Journal of Asian Studies?",
		  "answer": "The Berkeley Student Journal of Asian Studies (BSJAS) is an Institute of East Asian Studies sponsored journal that strives both to showcase the best undergraduate and graduate work at Berkeley in the field of Asian Studies and to give students aspiring to a future in academia a chance to practice the process of submission to a journal."
	  }, {
		  "question": "Who is eligible to submit an entry?",
		  "answer": "We encourage submissions from graduate and undergraduate students currently enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, or that have graduated within the past 12 months. Submissions can be from any discipline, as long as they are related to Asia and are original research."
	  }, {
		  "question": "When is the submission deadline?",
		  "answer": "The current deadline is January 16, 2016."
	  }, {
		  "question": "What is the submission process?",
			"answer": "The applicant first submits a publication for selection under the review of the Journal Committee. <span class='p'></span> If selected, the Journal Committee will correspond with the student to involve a Berkeley faculty member, who provides support to the student in the editing process by providing comments and additional feedback for final publication. <span class='p'></span> Your submission(s) must be completed for publication by the deadline set by the Journal Committee. The student will be notified of the opportunity to participate in a research symposium hosted by Berkeley Student Journal for Asian Studies."
	  }, {
		  "question": "What is considered an entry for submission?",
		  "answer": "While the Journal aims to showcase original research papers, book reviews, film reviews, etc., we also review creative works (e.g. art, poetry, photojournalism). Students wishing to interview selected faculty or submit cover art, are also invited to submit. The Journal Committee welcomes entries with relevance to “Asia,” as defined geographically by regions spanning East Asia, South and Southeast Asia, and Central Asia. If you are unsure if you work is relevant and eligible, feel free to contact us at <span class='blip'>berkeleysjas@gmail.com</span> for clarification."
	  }, {
		  "question": "Is there a specific format for submission?",
		  "answer": "Please submit documents in pdf format (for images, submit in TIFF, PNG, or JPEG format) to <span class='blip'>berkeleysjas@gmail.com</span>. Title the file YourName.pdf. Submissions must include a cover page with the author’s name, discipline, year in school, and formatted with one-inch margins, single-spaced, and Times New Roman 12 point font. Manuscripts must be from 1750-7500 words, and must include a 250 word abstract at the beginning of the document. <span class='p'></span> Article manuscripts must adhere to the Chicago Manual of Style. This means that submissions must have footnote citations and a works cited page. <span class='p'></span> Email all submissions to <span class='blip'><span class='blip'>berkeleysjas@gmail.com</span></span>. The subject line should say “BSJAS Entry: Paper Title”. The body of the email must include the following: <span class='p'></span> <ul><li>Author’s Full name</li> <li>Year (or date of graduation if recently matriculated)</li> <li>Major or Area of Study</li> <li>Title of Paper</li></ul>"
	  }, {
		  "question": "What determines selection and publication?",
		  "answer": "Each piece of work is evaluated by the following criteria:<span class='p'></span> <ul></br><li>Originality of work</li> <li>Assertion of a clear and significant argument</li> <li>Quality of the evidence provided to support claims</li> <li>Organization of ideas in guiding readers’ understanding</li> <li>Grammar, syntax, spelling</li></ul></br> <span class='p'></span> Moreover, while the Journal Committee chooses to evaluate each submission based on several criteria, we also approach and evaluate each entry holistically (particularly for creative works)."
	  }, {
		  "question": "Who is involved in the selection committee?",
		  "answer": "The Journal Committee is composed of student scholars involved in Asia-related studies, both undergraduate and graduate."
	  }, {
		  "question": "What if I miss the deadline for submission?",
		  "answer": "Students are encouraged to submit papers at any time up the deadline. However, if you miss our hard deadline (January 16, 2016 at 11:59 pm), then you will not be eligible for publication in this year’s edition of the journal. However, you may still be eligible for publication the following year. <span class='p'></span> If you are unsure of the deadline please email us at <span class='blip'>berkeleysjas@gmail.com</span> and we will inform you."
	  }, {
		  "question": "Is work from previous semesters eligible?",
		  "answer": "Yes. In our aim to collect Asia-related work, pieces for review and selection do not have to be from the past or current semester. As long as the information provided in the work remains factually correct, submissions need not be time-sensitive."
	  }, {
		  "question": "If I submitted a paper last semester for selection, should I submit it again?",
		  "answer": "Because we do accept work on a rolling basis, it would be best to notify us again during the submission period in the following semester if you wish to be included in the applicant pool. In regards to work that was reviewed but not selected, it would be best if changes were made to improve the work before submitting it once more."
	  }, {
		  "question": "How many pieces are selected?",
		  "answer": "Our journal is not currently maintained at any specified length. Historically, the committee has accepted between 4 and 6 papers, but this number is subject to change, depending on the number and quality of submissions. When selecting, we do take into consideration the academic level of the applicant, the topic of the submission, and the type of submission piece."
	  }, {
		  "question": "How often does the journal get published?",
		  "answer": "The Berkeley Student Journal of Asian Studies publishes once a year in the spring."
	  },

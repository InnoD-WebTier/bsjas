<b>President-elect Donald Trump might come as a shock to many Americans – but for the 600 million people of South East Asia the reaction could well be: “Seen it all before.” — Jonathan Head BBC News.</b>

Indeed, a head of state being elected based on identity politics and massive rural support is nothing new in Southeast Asia. From the movie star superficiality of Joseph Estrada to business tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra, Southeast Asia has had its share of leaders promising to dissolve the old order in the promise of “change.”

Of course you also have what people are deeming the “Asian Trump,” Rodrigo Duterte, who ran on a ballot that exemplified wiping out crime, shifting foreign policy, and fixing the corrupt and centralized Filipino system. If you count the state sponsored extrajudicial killings of thousands of Filipino citizens as well as denouncing President Obama and the United States as meeting the two requirements, then you could say he is indeed fulfilling his campaign promises.

Even in places like Burma, which previously showed progress when Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, won majorities in both houses in 2016 along with Cambodia’s return of Sam Rainsy, now experience human rights violations with issues regarding Rohingya Muslims and rights activists who demand for better working conditions.

What was a sliver of hope for the rule of law, civil society, economic prosperity during Obama’s “pivot towards Asia” speech, is now a murky picture of democratic ambiguity. Add a Trump administration that has no interest in foreign policy and that focuses on “values-based policy,” and there you have it– Southeast Asia’s version of “How to Get Away with Murder.”

Countries like Thailand and the Philippines, plagued by military violence and coercion, might be a lot happier with a president who turns a blind eye towards human right interventions and police brutality. Cambodia might also finally get a sense of relief when it doesn’t have the United States imposing economic or political sanctions upon its territories.

Authoritarian leaders welcome Trump’s trend-setting isolationism, as it means less US intervention on domestic issues, less accountability on human rights issues, and more freedom to cultivate a cult of corruption over a growth towards development.

Trump himself has also failed to show up to any summits hosted by Asian nations and he’s also made it quite clear that he rejects the United States’ membership in the Trans Pacific Partnership– a decision that has left both Vietnam and Japan in a state of shock and disappointment. His potential retreat from the region overall might open up the opportunity for China to become the de-facto powerhouse, something that countries like South Korea and Japan are not really looking forward to.

There is too much uncertainty in the air, both with what Trump’s foreign policy strategy is and what exactly is going on in his head, that it is difficult to make accurate predictions on what the future holds for Southeast Asia. What we do know however, is that if left unattended, Southeast Asia still has a box full of deadly, shocking, and “of course that’s happening in Southeast Asia” surprises waiting to be unpacked.

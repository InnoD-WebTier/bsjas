As everyone is aware, Donald Trump has been elected president of the United States of America. His ascendance comes as a bane for some and a boon for others. Although his position on American relations with Russia, China, and the Middle East are widely known and debated, there has been much less dialogue about his effect on the region located between these three areas – Central Asia. Although some believe that Trump’s administration will neglect the affairs of countries like Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, others believe that Central Asia will benefit from economic support through its ties with Russia.

Skeptics think that the new American administration’s ignorance of Central Asia will allow corruption to spread. Although Trump’s party platform unexpectedly included an emphasis on foreign investment and political reforms that can improve and stabilize Central Asia, critics of the president-elect have said that party platforms are merely hot air and do not show any concrete solutions. Furthermore, many argue that Trump’s harsh stance on freedom of the press and public protests may give Central Asian leaders a little more leeway in ignoring human rights in their countries and to thus act with impunity. These leaders would not have to worry about the United States’ involvement in their affairs, since intervention is likely off the table for Trump. Some even think that Trump’s history of business strategies could strengthen the kleptocracy in both Central Asia and the United States, where networks of government misconduct already seem to exist. In short, Trump’s presidency could spell doom for democracy in Central Asia.

On the other hand, Trump’s economic policies and relations with Russia could bring improvements to the region. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Central Asian countries have maintained healthy economic and political relationships with Russia. Immediately after winning the election, Trump spoke with Vladimir Putin on upholding peace between the two countries and easing economic sanctions. If Western sanctions on Russia were to loosen, the country’s economic growth would have a positive impact on its neighbors. This could also benefit the Central Asian states that have close trading ties with the country through agreements such as the Eurasian Economic Union. Finally, if Trump really were to promote foreign investments to and from Central Asia, the region would undoubtedly see significant growth.

Donald Trump’s election has stirred huge controversy around the world, and Central Asia has now become a part of the debate. The United States could either bring about neglect or improvements for the region, so uncertainty is still very high. Regardless of what happens, almost everyone is expecting change.

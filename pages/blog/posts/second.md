Hey, what's up? It's been a while since we wrote a blog post. Welcome to our new website!

This was one of the rare occasions where people from all over the world were able to witness Central Asian history and culture in action through the region's unique sports. Kok-boru was the highlight of the games for many viewers; the sport is extremely fast-paced and aggressive, with competitors galloping on horseback to gain control of a dead goat. In order to drop the carcass in the goal zone at the end of the field, players must go through a whirlwind of punches, whips, and battling horses. Many other sports at the games involved horseback riding, including racing, archery, and horseback wrestling.

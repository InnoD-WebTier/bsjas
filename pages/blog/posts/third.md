Hey, what's up? It's been a while since we wrote a blog post. Welcome to our new website!

At the beginning of September 2016, athletes from forty countries gathered to celebrate Central Asian culture and traditions at the World Nomad Games in Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyzstan. The games included many different sports that were historically played by the nomadic peoples of Central Asia, such as hunting with eagles and dogs, archery, mas-wrestling (a competition between two wrestlers trying to grasp a small stick), and the fast and fierce sport of kok-boru (a nomadic version of polo where riders on horseback fight over a beheaded goat carcass). Although the majority of athletes at the games represented countries with nomadic backgrounds, such as Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and other Central Asian states, there were also participants from nations ranging from the United States to Zimbabwe.

## Contributing Guidelines
* For SASS guidelines, please reference the Airbnb [styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/css#sass)
* Nest your CSS if you can, it helps to reduce the volume of code and adds clarity
* Use predefined variables and classes if they already exist, don't reinvent the wheel
* Don't use generic class names, scope them to the page you're on
* Try to use % or rem over px for values
* Don't use br tags unless you absolutely have to
